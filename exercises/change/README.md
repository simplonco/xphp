Write a program that will correctly determine the least number of coins
to be given to the user such that the sum of the coins' value would
equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) or [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
